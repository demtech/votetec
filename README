This is an implementation of a voting scheme that is based on 
a paper published at revote 2009.  This system was created
as a study project by Eric Cederstrand and Kenneth Sjøholm.
Their report can be found here: http://

Edit the file Election.xml to describe the election.

Run the election by starting "java Evoting"

VoteTec generates out of Election.xml user interface and 
Twelf files.

Note: This system does not use any crypto to protect against
all kinds of attacks.  This is not a short coming in the implementation
but was not intended to be part of the project.
