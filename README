This is an implementation of a voting scheme that is based on a paper
published at REVOTE 2009, "Electronic Elections: Trust Through
Engineering" by Carsten Schuermann.

http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/conf/re/revote2009.html

This system was created as a study project by Eric Cederstrand and
Kenneth Sjøholm.  Their report and a copy of the above paper is in
this repository in the docs directory.

Edit the file Election.xml to describe the election.

Run the election by starting "java Evoting".

VoteTec generates out of Election.xml user interface and Twelf files.

Note: This system does not use any crypto to protect against all kinds
of attacks.  This is not a shortcoming in the implementation, but was
not intended to be part of the project.  The point of this project is
to experiment with logic-based election protocols and integration
between off-the-shelf mainstream software (in this case, written in
Java) and logical frameworks like Twelf.
